# Kasumi
A powerful, and extensively customizable open-source server API for [**Minecraft: Java Edition**](https://minecraft.net).

## About Kasumi

Kasumi is a powerful, and expansive [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) server API made in [node.js](https://nodejs.org), built with features to make creating advanced and dynamic instances far easier, all with an open and capable plugin API, and more!

The higher difference between this and other given libraries is that it aims to provide a lightweight variant of the Minecraft server software, to the best of our capabilities whilst mimicing the tidbits and features of normal Java Edition.

Kasumi is meant to be avidly used at it's core base; as a full-blown server library. While it can be used as a server by itself if handled properly, the handling plugins automatically, and most of the upper folder handling should be left to the user utilizing the library.

### Ongoing Goals

At the time of writing this, our full goal is provide an advanced, dev-friendly plugin API that allows for full interfacing on a Minecraft server, as similarly as to what you would see when using Bukkit or Spigot.

#### Project Status

Currently, we're in an ***extremely*** early stage of development, having a ton of unimplemented features and components.

### Supported Versions

Currently, Kasumi only has support for [Minecraft 1.17](), and will currently reject lower versions until we have a functioning outline for our work.

Currently, the idea of maintaining branches for each major version of Minecraft individually is in the air.

## Installation

Kasumi aims to provide advantages over using a server like Bukkit, and Spigot; such as:

* Kasumi is written to support concurrency based further on event loops, making it easier for plugins to handle specific events more properly.
* It is designed to better handle memory, and make it easier on server owners to alleviate server costs.
* Kasumi is open-sourced! This makes it easier for people to take ganders at our codebase, and to help contribute to the development of Kasumi.
    * Projects like Spigot and Bukkit are locked behind walls of copyright, as they fork off of and rely on the decompiled code of Minecraft; while we aim to emulate and improve it.
* Kasumi provides easier and rich APIs for plugins to utilize, alongside for developers to implement to the server.

## Installation
*Node.js v14 or above is required to utilize this application.*
